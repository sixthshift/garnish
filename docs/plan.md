# Plan

Implementation plan for garnish, stage 2 (UI), written to be executed one task per loop iteration with no human present. Decisions live in [decisions.md](decisions.md), shape in [architecture.md](architecture.md), boundaries in [scope.md](scope.md). Run it with `/ailoop` (see `.claude/skills/ailoop/SKILL.md`): one fresh subagent per task, the orchestrator verifies and records. This file is edited only by the orchestrator. Completed stages live in `docs/plans/`; stage 1 is [v1-foundations.md](plans/v1-foundations.md).

## Loop protocol

What one task looks like, whoever runs it (an ailoop subagent, a /loop firing, or a person):

1. Read this file. Read `CLAUDE.md`. Do not re-read the other docs unless a task points at them.
2. Pick the first unchecked task whose dependencies are checked. Milestones run in order; tasks within a milestone run in order unless marked `∥`. A `!` before the task id asks `/ailoop` to dispatch it on a stronger model; the skill's Model section has the rules.
3. Do that one task. Nothing else. No drive-by refactors, no adjacent tasks.
4. Verify with the task's own check. Then run the full gate:
   ```
   bun run check     # tsc --noEmit
   bun run test      # vitest run
   ```
   Both must pass. A failing gate is not done. Fix it or revert the task.
5. Commit with a one-line message naming the task id, e.g. `M1.3 recipe document schema`. Attribution trailer per `CLAUDE.md`.
6. Report. Under `/ailoop` the orchestrator ticks the task, appends the Log line and commits; a subagent never edits this file. Under `/loop`, do it yourself.
7. Stop. One task per iteration.

Rules:

- **Blocked?** Write the blocker under Blocked with the task id and what you tried. Move to the next task that does not depend on it. Never guess past a blocker on a decision; guess freely on implementation detail, and when unsure copy Mealie.
- **Question for Jason?** Write it under Questions. Pick the Mealie answer and continue. Do not stop.
- **Found a design gap?** Add a row to `decisions.md`. Do not edit existing rows. Note it in the Log.
- **Framework questions?** TanStack Start docs at https://tanstack.com/start/latest. Server functions for app calls, server routes only under `src/routes/api/`. SPA mode stays on.
- **UI element needed?** Check the design system's exports first (`node_modules/@sixthshift/design-system/package.json`). Build locally only if absent, under `src/components/ui/`.
- **Task too big for one iteration?** Split it in place into `Mx.y.a`, `Mx.y.b`. Do the first part.
- **Tests:** every pure function and every API route gets tests in the same task that creates it. No task is done with a TODO test.
- **No new dependencies** beyond the list in M0 without a decisions.md row saying why.

## Layout

```
src/
  routes/       TanStack Start file routes: pages, and server routes under routes/api/
  server/       server functions (createServerFn), grouped by resource; db access only here
  db/           migrations/*.sql, migrate.ts, seed.ts, repositories
  domain/       zod schemas, scaling, formatting. Pure, no IO, importable by client
  components/   React components; ui/ holds local primitives the design system lacks
  lib/          client-side helpers (mutate + router.invalidate)
  styles.css    Tailwind entry with the design system's three lines
  router.tsx    getRouter()
vite.config.ts  tanstackStart({ spa }), nitro({ preset: 'bun' }), viteReact(), tailwindcss()
test/           mirrors src/
data/           runtime volume: garnish.db, images/, backups/  (gitignored)
```

Scripts in `package.json`: `dev` (`bun --bun vite dev`), `build` (`bun --bun vite build`), `start` (`bun run .output/server/index.mjs`), `check` (`tsc --noEmit`), `test` (`vitest run`), `migrate`, `seed`, `backup`.
